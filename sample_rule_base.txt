location -> doctor's pc, hospital pc, outside

rule 1: if the doctor accesses data from his own allocated hospital pc, then there are less chances of him being malicious.

rule 2: if the doctor accesses data from a hospital pc, not allocated to him, then there are medium chances of him being malicious.

rule 3: if the doctor accesses data from his outside, then there are more chances of him being malicious.


data sensitivity -> full access, medium access, low / no access

rule 1: general data will come under full access.

rule 2: organ specific data and tests(based on relevancy PS: I suggest we put medical tests criteria in the relevance section) will come under medium access and whether access will be granted will depend on other factors.

rule 3: things like mediclaim will come under low / no access.

# will be based on doctor's specialization
relevance -> yes, no

rule 1: if the data accessed is related to the doctor's specialization, access will be granted.

rule 2: if the data accessed is not related, chances of doctor being malicious are more.

emergency -> yes, no

rule 1: if it's an emergency grant access to all kinds of data, and dont consider the time factor then

rule 2: if there's no emergency, check other factors

time of the day -> hospital hours, other

rule 1: if the doctor accesses data during hospital hours then there are less chances of him being malicious

rule 2: if the doctor acccesses data outside of hospital hours then there are more chances of him being malicious
