the process begins with a doctor requesting a certain data about a certain patient.

The query is processed to find out the location of access, time of access and also
the type of data. Whether the access is an emergency case or not is also mentioned
by the doctor beforehand. All these, along with the previous history are
combimed to form an input.
If the network is not already trained the input is passed to the knowledge base so
as to calculate the initial weights and also to the neural network as part of the
training data. The neural network produces a certain output which is compared
with the desired output (derived from the knowledge base) and the weights are
adjusted accordingly. The loop continues till the network produces output as
expected.
If the network is trained, the input is passed to the neural network and the actual
output of the system is produced. This is again compared with a desired output, i.e.
a threshold, hence producing a final output of the system, whether or not access
will be granted.
Finally the activity is logged into the previous history database for future
reference.
